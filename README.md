# Project_Quake4
Project to modify Quake 4 Source code

To play my modpack use MidtermProject branch from this repo. 
make a mods folder in with any name you want. copy the game000.pk4 file from q4base folder already in you game folder. 

open the game000.pk4 file, and copy the gamex86.dll (inside modded_gamedll folder) from the repo into this zip file. 
copy the zer0l0gic.cfg file (inside modded_cfgs folder) straight into the your modpack folder.
copy the rest of the modded_* folders into your modpack folder and rename them without the "modded_" portion

Now you can start your game and load up the Modpack. 

If you had previous saved games, dont use them here. You need to load a new game. 

On Load, you will see Material Value at top right, which is the material used for your 3D Printer. 
To access the 3D printer, Press 'b' and press 'b' again to exit the 3D printer GUI. 
To get more material, you have to personally kill enemies, which will give you 200 material. 
The Compass Points to your first Objective. And Upon Getting near your objective location, it will change location to next objective. 
There will be weapon placements all around the spawn, for you to prepare for your saving of the world.
All Weapons have been give increased stats, to help you survive and save the world before it is too late. 

Minor Details: <br>
All Player Weapons, have improvements, like increased range/FireRate/damage/bulletCount and/or decreased recoil impact.
FYI: The NAIL GUN has been changed so, now it will teleport you to where ever the projectile is shot. 
Scoping into Machine Gun will make it have increased damage.
